Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.

2.The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.

3.The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.


                      binary search algorithm
					  -----------------------
Compare x with the middle element.

If x matches with the middle element, we return the mid index.

Else if x is greater than the mid element, then x can only lie in the right (greater) half subarray after the mid element. Then we apply the algorithm 
again for the right half.

Else if x is smaller, the target x must lie in the left (lower) half. So we apply the algorithm for the left half.
